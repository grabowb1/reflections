When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I would work with other people on the same project e.g. a group
  project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Automatic pull could would change the files I would like to edit or expand
  without me knowing about it and it could cause some issues and conflicts.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?
  Branches are different pathes of commits in a single repository.
  Clones are copies of entire repositories.
  Forks are clones on GitHub.
