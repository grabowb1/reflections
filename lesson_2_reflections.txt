What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When I initialize a repository a .git directory is made.
	I need to do it, so that Git starts to track my repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
	In staging area are the files that are going to be commited,
	files in working directory will not.
