What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When I initialize a repository a .git directory is made.
	I need to do it, so that Git starts to track my repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
	In staging area are the files that are going to be commited,
	files in working directory will not.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	I can use commands like git diff and git diff --staging to make sure
	that there is only one logical change in a commit.
